<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my portfolio website! <br/>
   
 <p> Hi, my name is Amina and I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence which I'm really enjoying. 
As a first-year AI student, I'm deeply passionate about exploring the endless possibilities of technology. 
With every lecture and project, I find myself immersed in the fascinating world of Artificial 
Intelligence, constantly learning and evolving.
</p>

<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests 
that keep me engaged and curious. One of my greatest passions is
reading books. From romance novels to financial guides to poetry 
collections, I enjoy delving into various genres to expand my horizons
and gain new perspectives. Exploring different subjects through literature
allows me to continuously grow and challenge myself.</p>

<p>In addition to my love for reading, I thrive on trying out new experiences
and pushing my boundaries. Whether it's experimenting with coding languages
or exploring unfamiliar topics, I believe that stepping out of my comfort zone
is essential for personal and intellectual growth.</p>

<p>Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my journey as a student and aspiring web developer,
Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to join me on this exciting adventure!
